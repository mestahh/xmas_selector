Helps cherry pick Xmas present selection in a big family

In our big family grown ups won't buy presents to everyone anymore. 
Instead we used to cherry-pick only a single person. Noone knows who picked who. 
This year we could not gather around the table all to pick, so I wrote this little app.

You have to add members in the bin/selector_sender.rb file.
You can define a list for every member of the family (or friend group) that they are not allowed to pick (spouse, etc.). 
Leave it as an empyt list if it's not relevant.

If you have 2 factor authentication enabled in gmail (as the app uses gmail right now to send out letters), 
enable the app in the Gmail security settings.

Merry Xmas!
